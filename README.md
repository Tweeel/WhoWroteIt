# WhoWroteIt

an app that contains an EditText and a Button.

The user enters the name of the book in the EditText and taps the button.
The button executes an AsyncTask that queries the Google Books API to find the author and title of the book the user is looking for.
The results are retrieved and displayed in a TextView below the button.
